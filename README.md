# My Adguard Allow List
Some upstream blocklists are too aggressive and block some meaningless domains that can be safely allowed, which can cause issues with some services or drain the battery faster.

This is a list of domains that I found to be safe to allow while still keeping private and secure.

Each domain is checked for safety and relevance.

## Usage
You can use this list with AdGuard Home or any other DNS server that supports [Adblock-style syntax](https://adguard-dns.io/kb/general/dns-filtering-syntax/#adblock-style-syntax).

Just subscribe to the `allowlist.txt` file in the settings.
